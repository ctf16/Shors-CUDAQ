        "\n",
        "The streamlined Shor's algorithm assumes two things: `N` is odd and not a prime power (can be represented as a positive integer power of a prime number). These are basic assumptions since either of these conditions being false would mean that N is not prime factorable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The classical reduction mainly consists of generating a random `a`, finding `K = GCD(a,N)`, and then calling the quantum order-finding kernel. If `K != 1`, then `K` is a nontrivial factor of `N` and the other factor is `N/K`, and we have successfully found nontrivial factors of `N`. If `K = 1`, we call the quantum kernel to find order `r` of `a`. Due to the way the problem is broken down, `r` must be even; if it isn't, then we restart and find a new `a`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once returning from the quantum kernel with an even `r`, we calculate $x = a^\\frac{r}{2} - 1$ and `d = GCD(x,N)`. If `d > 1`, then it is one of our factors, with `N/d` being the other.\n",
